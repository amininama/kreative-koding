everything is inside sketches directory for now
I don't think we needed to init a node project here

in order to create a new sketch:
npx canvas-sketch sketch-01.js --new
This will generate a new js file and start serving over a certain local port

in order to continue working on a sketch:
npx canvas-sketch sketch-01.js

saving the animation:
1- make sure to have ffmpeg in the same dependency set of canvas-sketch
npm install @ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg
2- run the canvas-sketch:
npm canvas-sketch sketch-01.js --output=tmp --stream=mp4 
3- Ctrl+Shft+S to start capturing
4- Ctrl+Shft+S to stop capturing
5- look for the file in tmp folder under the sketches directory
